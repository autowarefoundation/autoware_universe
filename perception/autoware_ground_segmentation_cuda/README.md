# autoware_ground_segmentation_cuda

## Purpose

The `autoware_ground_segmentation` algorithms have been thoroughly tested with Autoware. However, due to latency and high computational cost when processing large pointcloud, the input pointcloud range has been limited by the `crop_box_filter` based on the ego-vehicle's `base_link`. This can cause unwanted object loss, especially before a sloped road.

Recently, GPU and CUDA-supported libraries such as [cuda_blackboard](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/cuda_blackboard/blob/1837689df2891f6223f07c178c21aed252566ede/README.md) and accelerated versions of [`autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor`](../../sensing/autoware_cuda_pointcloud_preprocessor/README.md) have been implemented. These can be leveraged to improve the performance of ground segmentation filter algorithms using CUDA/GPU.

This package reimplements the current scan_ground_filter of the ground_segmentation package to reduce latency and avoid the bottleneck caused by processing a large number of point clouds.

## Inner-workings / Algorithm

The detailed algorithm is available in [scan-ground-filter.md](../autoware_ground_segmentation/docs/scan-ground-filter.md).
