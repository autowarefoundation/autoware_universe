# Planning Validator

The `autoware_planning_validator` is a module that checks the validity of a trajectory before it is published. The status of the validation can be viewed in the `/diagnostics` and `/validation_status` topics. When an invalid trajectory is detected, the `autoware_planning_validator` will process the trajectory following the selected option: "0. publish the trajectory as it is", "1. stop publishing the trajectory", "2. publish the last validated trajectory".

## Supported features

The following features are supported for trajectory validation and can have thresholds set by parameters:

- **Invalid field** : e.g. Inf, Nan
- **Trajectory points interval** : invalid if any of the distance of trajectory points is too large
- **Curvature** : invalid if the trajectory has too sharp turns that is not feasible for the given vehicle kinematics
- **Relative angle** : invalid if the yaw angle changes too fast in the sequence of trajectory points
- **Lateral acceleration** : invalid if the expected lateral acceleration/deceleration is too large. Lateral acceleration is calculated using the formula:

  $$
  a_{lat} = v_{lon}^2 * \kappa
  $$

  Where $v_{lon}$ is longitudinal velocity and $\kappa$ is curvature. Since the acceleration embedded in path points is perpendicular to the derived lateral acceleration, projections are not considered. The velocity and acceleration assigned to each point are directed toward the next path point.

- **Lateral jerk** : invalid if the rate of change of lateral acceleration is too large. Lateral jerk is calculated using the formula:

  $$
  j_{lat} = v_{lon}^3 * \frac{d\kappa}{ds} + 3 * v_{lon}^2 * a_{lon} * \kappa
  $$

  Where $v_{lon}$ is longitudinal velocity, $\kappa$ is curvature, $a_{lon}$ is longitudinal acceleration, and $\frac{d\kappa}{ds}$ is the rate of curvature change with respect to distance. In this implementation, the curvature change ($\frac{d\kappa}{ds}$) is not considered, simplifying the calculation to only the second term. The lateral jerk represents how quickly the lateral acceleration changes, which affects ride comfort and vehicle stability.

- **Longitudinal acceleration/deceleration** : invalid if the acceleration/deceleration in the trajectory point is too large
- **Steering angle** : invalid if the expected steering value is too large estimated from trajectory curvature
- **Steering angle rate** : invalid if the expected steering rate value is too large
- **Velocity deviation** : invalid if the planning velocity is too far from the ego velocity
- **Distance deviation** : invalid if the ego is too far from the trajectory
- **Longitudinal distance deviation** : invalid if the trajectory is too far from ego in longitudinal direction
- **Forward trajectory length** : invalid if the trajectory length is not enough to stop within a given deceleration
- **Yaw difference** : invalid if the difference between the ego yaw and closest trajectory yaw is too large
- **Trajectory Shift** : invalid if the lat./long. distance between two consecutive trajectories near the Ego exceed the thresholds.

The following features are to be implemented.

- **(TODO) TTC calculation** : invalid if the expected time-to-collision is too short on the trajectory
